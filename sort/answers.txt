sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Fastest to sort sorted50000.txt indicating O(n) in the order of n

sort2 uses: merge sort

                  while other sorts took more time indicating O(n) in the order of n squared.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: sort3 was the slowest to sort sorted50000.txt indicating O(n) in the order of n squared
